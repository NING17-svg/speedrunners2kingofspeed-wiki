## Change Log

### 2026-09-16 - Multi-platform launch and console availability update

- Task: Update release, price, and crossplay pages to reflect the simultaneous 2026-09-03 launch on Steam (Windows), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch with day-one Xbox Game Pass and full cross-play across all four platforms.
- Files changed: `src/data/pages/home.ts`, `src/data/pages/fixed-pages.ts` (`release-platforms`, `crossplay-online`, `price-editions`), `src/data/faq.ts`, `src/data/navigation.ts`, `CONTENT_INDEX.md`.
- URLs affected: `/`, `/release`, `/crossplay`, `/price`.
- SEO/GEO changed: Home hero and quick answer updated for multi-platform launch; release, crossplay, and price pages carry the Game Pass callout and a storefront-label-gap callout on crossplay; FAQ entries updated for crossplay and Game Pass; primary navigation unchanged (existing routes only).
- Verification: `npm run verify` must succeed before pushing the target commit.

### 2026-09-16 - Story campaign characters, mission types, and bosses update

- Task: Add the named Story campaign heroes and villains (Moonraker, Falcon, Dart, Hothead, Cosmonaut Comrade, Unic, SpeedRunner), the five mission types (Classic, Lap Race, Skyfall Rush, Boss Battle, Escape Missions), and the Five Movers Boss Battle mechanic.
- Files changed: `src/data/pages/home.ts`, `src/data/pages/fixed-pages.ts` (`characters-abilities`, `tracks-game-modes`, new `story-campaign`, `wiki`, `faq`, `guides`), `src/data/faq.ts`, `src/data/navigation.ts`, `CONTENT_INDEX.md`.
- URLs affected: `/`, `/characters`, `/tracks-modes`, new `/story-campaign`, `/wiki`, `/faq`, `/guides`.
- SEO/GEO changed: New `/story-campaign` page lists the cast, mission types, and Boss Battle mechanic; `/characters` now carries a Story campaign roster table; `/tracks-modes` links out to the Story campaign page; primary navigation gains a Story campaign entry; FAQ schema covers Story characters, mission types, and Boss Battle.
- Verification: `npm run verify` must succeed before pushing the target commit.

### 2026-09-08 - Adsterra integration (speedrunners2kingofspeed-wiki launch)

- Task: Replace empty placeholder values in `src/data/ads.ts` with real Adsterra Native Banner, Banner 728x90 / 468x60 / 320x50 / 160x600, and Smartlink codes produced by `adsterra-integrator`.
- Files changed: `src/data/ads.ts`.
- URLs affected: None — ad components and positions were predefined by the one-click builder; this entry only fills the existing ad slots.
- SEO/GEO changed: No surface-level change; search and discoverability unchanged. Real ad codes are now wired into the existing Adsterra-ready modules.
- Verification: `npm run verify` must succeed before pushing the target commit; adsterra-integrator validator reconciles registry, target `ads.ts`, private config/codes, and target domain.

### 2026-08-12 - Static discovery and review freshness baseline added

- Task: Add locale-aware static search, automatic recent updates, visible review dates, and browser metadata/security defaults to the shared template.
- Files changed: Header/search components, content helpers, locale UI labels, homepage/page hero rendering, manifest/favicon metadata, Next.js security headers, and deterministic validators.
- URLs affected: No existing URLs changed; search results use the final route manifest URLs and recent updates use existing indexable pages.
- SEO/GEO changed: Last reviewed dates are public on every page; the homepage surfaces recent non-trust content by deterministic `lastReviewed` order; locale search never falls back across locales. Search indexes are emitted as per-locale force-static resources and lazy-loaded so full-site index data is not repeated in every page payload.
- Browser baseline: Neutral SVG favicon, web manifest, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `X-Frame-Options` are wired without adding a restrictive CSP.
- Verification: Typecheck, lint, template/content/SEO validation, and full verify are required before launch.

### 2026-07-21 - V3 locale and entity routing added

- Task: Upgrade the shared template for configuration-driven locale routes and programmatic entity pages.
- Files changed: Site/page/entity types, locale and entity generators, dynamic routes, metadata, sitemap, validators, and template documentation.
- URLs affected: Existing primary-locale URLs retain their paths; additional locale and entity routes are generated from configuration.
- SEO changed: Canonical, hreflang, x-default, Open Graph locale, multilingual sitemap alternates, and final route-manifest validation are now data-driven.
- Entity changed: Generic entity Hubs/details now render source links, relationships, and optional registered local images from one base fact package.
- Verification: Typecheck, template validation, content validation, rendered SEO validation, route-manifest generation, and multilingual entity fixtures.

### YYYY-MM-DD - Template baseline initialized

- Task: Create the initial generated guide-site baseline.
- Files changed: Template project files.
- URLs affected: `/`, `/wiki`, `/guides`, `/release-date`, `/faq`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/privacy-policy`, `/terms`.
- Content changed: Neutral placeholder content only.
- Ad baseline: Fixed Adsterra-ready modules are present and disabled; no ad markup or request is emitted.
- Follow-up: Replace this entry with a real launch/configuration entry when the one-click builder fills the site for a specific game.
